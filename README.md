# Fitting Application Gui
 Working on creating an application that fits a selected function/fitting method to a data set that is supplied by the user.


 This app is a data fitting GUI that allows users to load datasets from Excel or pickle files, select variables for x and y, and apply various fitting techniques such as linear fits and power-law fits with or without uncertainties. The app displays the data along with the fitted curve, providing relevant parameters like slope, intercept, and Chi-squared values. Polynomial fits just added too.

I plan to expand the app with more complex fitting techniques, such as Chebyshev polynomial fitting or other advanced methods, making it highly versatile for different kinds of data. Ultimately, I'll turn this into an executable .exe application for easy distribution and use.


So far, just handles the following fitting techniques: linear fit (no uncertainties), linear fit (weighted uncertainties) and power-law fits (with weighted uncertainties).
